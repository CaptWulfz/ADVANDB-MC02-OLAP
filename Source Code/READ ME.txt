Notes on WDI OLAP:
 * The entire folder is a Java Project so just import
 * There are 3 packages within the project: default, gui and util.
   > default package - Driver Class
   > gui package - All Classes regarding the GUI
   > util package - All Classes regarding the Database
 * When overwriting and not using this as the main folder please just delete the project in this folder and replace with your own updated copy
 * Inside the folder is a folder called "jarlib" which contains any external jar files that is needed by the project but not in the default library
